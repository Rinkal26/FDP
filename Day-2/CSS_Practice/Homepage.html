    <p id="flower">The Flower Theory is a quaint boutique flower shop in the heart of Downtown Danville. We specialize in making custom designed arrangements for the daily and celebrated events in your life. Each arrangement is Made- to- Order using fresh seasonal blooms and specialty flowers in our signature weekly color pallets. We love what we do and we hope you can see that represented through our work. So give us a try.A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but does a selection of roses of any old color look good? Probably not; just ask Darroch and Michael Putnam, the acclaimed US floral designers and founders of Putnam & Putnam, suppliers of flowers to such notable figures as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jason Wu, Brandon Maxwell and Beyonc√©, among others.</div>
